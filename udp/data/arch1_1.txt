"Keep Yourself Alive"

I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day

But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile

Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day

Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
Stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays

Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
Well I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal

I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day

But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive
Come on
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive

Shake

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive
Come on
Keep yourself alive
You take your time and take more money
Keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive
Come on
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive
Come on
Come on
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Take you all your time and money
Honey you will survive

Keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied

"Seven Seas Of Rhye"

Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye

Can you hear me you peers and privy counselors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye

Sister - I live and lie for you
Mister - do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever

Storm the master-marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder-fire I'll survive
Then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive
Then I'll get you

Be gone with you - you shod and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye



She keeps MoÃ«t et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake,' she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try


"Bohemian Rhapsody"

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide,
No escape from reality.

Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little
